C# supports a variety of built-in data types such as int, double, char, bool, and string, each designed to handle different kinds of data. Beyond these, developers can also create custom data types and leverage object references to support rich object-oriented designs within the .NET Core environment.\",\n",

Reference types, on the other hand, such as classes and arrays, are stored on the heap, and variables hold a reference to the data's location in memory. This has implications for performance and memory management, especially in an object-oriented context. Moreover, it is important to follow best practices: choose descriptive names, limit the scope of variables to where they are needed, and select the appropriate type to accurately represent your data.
